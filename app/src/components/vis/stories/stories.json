Identifying street segments of high stress and exploring the underlying measures or indicators contributing to the classifcation can help to inform priorities for investment. This map depicts levels of traffic stress for Melbourne, Australia, according to two classification standards: one tailored for the Victorian policy context based and another using traffic stress classification based on UK policy, allowing for comparisons between the two approaches.",

The classification ranges from 1 (lowest stress, for use by all cyclists) to 4 (most stressful, and least suitable for safe cycling).

However, environmental aspects such as greenery and shade are also factors influencing cycling choices.</p>",
